## 🔢 Digit Occurrence Counter – Java 🔢

## ❓ Problem Statement  

Write a **Java program** that counts how many times a **specific digit** appears within a **range of numbers**.  
The program should take a digit to search for and a last number, then scan all numbers in that range and count how many times the digit occurs.

---

## 📥 Input  

1️⃣ User enters a **digit** to search for (0–9)  
2️⃣ User enters the **last number (n)** up to which the search should be performed  

---

## 📤 Output  

The program should print:

✔ Total number of times the digit appears  
✔ Error messages for invalid input when needed  

---

## 🎯 Task  

- Take user input using `Scanner`  
- Use a `for` loop to iterate from the digit value to the last number  
- Extract digits using `%` and `/` operators  
- Count how many times the given digit appears  
- Handle invalid cases like:
  - Negative numbers  
  - Last number smaller than the digit  

---

## 🧠 Rules to Follow  

- Use **int** data type only  
- Do not use arrays or strings for digit extraction  
- Use loops and conditional statements  
- Keep the program simple and beginner-friendly  

---

## ✅ Goal  

Build a **Java program** that helps understand **loops, conditions, and digit extraction logic** by solving a real-world counting problem 🔍💻
