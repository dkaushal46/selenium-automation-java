### 🚀 Java Exercise – Find Odd and Even Number Before a Given Number

📝 **Problem Statement:**  
Write a Java program that takes an integer input `a` and determines:

- The largest **odd number** less than `a`.  
- The largest **even number** less than `a`.  

If such numbers do not exist (e.g., for input 1 or 2), handle these edge cases by printing appropriate messages.

🧠 **Example:**  
If input is `6`:  
The odd number before 6 is 5
The even number before 6 is 4

If input is `2`:  
The odd number before 2 is 1
The even number before 2 doesn't exist

If input is `1`:  
The odd number before 1 doesn't exist
The even number before 1 doesn't exist
